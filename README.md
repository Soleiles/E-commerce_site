## Description

This project was done to practice the use of Object Relational Mapping (ORM) with the work of Sequelize. ORM allows us to easily work with databases from a Node server. We also learned to create API routes as a part of our backend development.

## Installation

- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/) is required in order to run this application.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (from v16 to v18) is required to run this application.

- In the MySQL shell, the schema file needs to be run by typing `source db/schema.sql`.
- After exiting MySQL shell, typing `node seeds` into the terminal to execute the seed scripts.
- Then start the server by typing `node server`.

### Dependencies

Type the following in the terminal:

`npm i express sequelize mysql2 dotenv`

- These packages are required for the application to run.
